Description: Statistically valid p-values should have uniform density\;
  frequentist confidence intervals (CI) should achieve (at least) nominal 
  coverage, andbe unbiased in the sense that the probability that the target 
  value falls below the CI is equal to the probablility that the target value 
  falls above the CI. These properties are guaranteed with pivotal statistics for 
  continuous distributions but not for many statistical applications of p-values 
  and CI. In such cases p-values and CI may be visually tested with checkplots 
  (which assess the uniformity of p-values) and with rangeplots, a family of plots 
  to vizualize the distribution of CI under monte-carlo sampling.
